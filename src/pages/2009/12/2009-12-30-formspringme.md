It has grown on me more than I thought it would. There’s a lot of diversity and choices like the food we eat, how we travel (train, bus, car, taxi), and what we do at night.

I love being surrounded by strangers. I was tired of running into someone I knew any and every time I went out in Bloomington whether it was getting lunch, going to a bar, or just crossing the street.

I’ve also started to appreciate the faster pace of the city. I’m pretty laid back, but I notice a subtle slower pace whenever I get out of the city.
