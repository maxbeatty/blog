> I miss Sophia. I called her yesterday to tell her that. I said, Sophia the house is so quiet without you, the TV isn’t blaring and your messes aren’t everywhere. She replied, “see, you people take me for granted.”

This is from an email my [step-mom](http://kim.beatty.me) sent me. My little sister [Sophia](http://sophia.storer.me) has been visiting family if Florida for the past few weeks, and I think it has snuck up on everyone how much they miss her being around. We really need to start documenting all the [funny things Sophia says](http://courtney.storer.me/post/142441955/another-beatty-moment).
