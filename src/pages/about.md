Howdy! I'm a software engineering leader based in San Francisco. I enjoy wearing many hats to design and build products for the web from scratch. Some of my past projects include [Pass Plum](https://passplum.com/) and [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv). When I'm not coding, you can find me playing basketball, tennis, and Euchre.
